### Description
This game is meant to provide a visual representation of angular momentum in action. The game starts out with a ball fixed on a horizontal axis and a rod fixed around the center of the screen. The player must launch the ball at the rod such that the rod will stop within a certain area highlighted on screen. The player must also take into account various factors such as the mass of the ball and the mass of the rod.

### How to Play
The ball is fixed on a horizontal axis, and will move left or right to follow your cursor. By clicking on the ball and dragging back, the player can control both the angle of approach and the initial velocity of the ball, and just has to release to launch the ball. When the player wins they can move on to a new level with new variables.

### How it Works
If the player successfully launches the ball into the rod, it will stick after making contact, transferring all of its angular momentum to the ball-rod system. The ball’s velocity, the system’s angular velocity, the mass of the ball and the rod, the length of the rod, and the coefficient of friction between the system and the surface are all accounted for and monitored on a side display. A highlighted area will be marked, and the player will have to land the rod within that zone in order to try the simulation with new variables. Their success is determined by whether or not a line marked on the rod falls within the given area (the line being along the center vertical axis of the rod).
